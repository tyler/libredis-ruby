/*
 * This is the public C API of the libredis library.
 *
 * The library should be initialized first using the 'Module_new' function to get reference to the library.
 * Then you can set some optional properties (using 'Module_set_XXX' functions) to configure the library.
 * Finally you should call Module_init to initialize the library proper.
 * At the end of your program, call 'Module_free' to release all resources in use by the library.
 *
 * The API is written in a 'pseudo' object oriented style, using only opaque references to the Batch, Connection and Executor 'Classes'.
 * Each of these will be created and destroyed using their respective XXX_new() and XXX_free methods.
 *
 * In order to communicate with a Redis server you will need at least to create an instance of Batch, Connection and Executor. e.g.:
 *
 * Batch *batch = Batch_new();
 * Connection *connection = Connection_new("127.0.0.1:6379");
 * Executor *executor = Executor_new();
 *
 * One or more Redis commands can be written into the batch using the Batch_write_XXX functions:
 *
 * Batch_write(batch, "GET foo\r\n", 9, 1);
 *
 * Then we tell the library that we want to execute these commands on a specific Redis server by associating the Batch
 * and Connection using the 'Executor_add' function.
 *
 * Executor_add(executor, connection, batch);
 *
 * Note that we can associate multiple (connection, batch) pairs by calling the Executor_add function for each pair.
 *
 * Then we will execute all of the commands against all of the connections in parallel by calling Executer_execute,
 * with a timeout specified in milliseconds.
 *
 * Executor_execute(executor, 500);
 *
 * This method returns when all replies have been received, or a timeout has occurred.
 *
 * If everything went well we can now read the replies from our batch (or batches):
 *
 * ReplyType reply_type;
 * char *reply_data;
 * size_t reply_len;
 * int level;
 * while(level = Batch_next_reply(batch, &reply_type, &reply_data, &reply_len)) {
 * 		printf("level: %d, reply type: %d, data: '%.*s'\n", level, (int)reply_type, reply_len, reply_data);
 * }
 *
 * If a function returns an error code (e.g. -1). You can call Module_last_error to get a textual description of the error.
 *
 * If a reply is an error reply (RT_ERROR type), the textual description will be in the reply_data.

/**
* Create a new ketama consistent hashing object.

* A good explanation of consistent hashing can be found here:
* http://www.tomkleinpeter.com/2008/03/17/programmers-toolbox-part-3-consistent-hashing/

*
* Basic usage:
*
* Ketama *ketama = Ketama_new(); //create a new ketama object
* //add your server list:
* Ketama_add_server(ketama, '127.0.0.1', 6379, 100);

* Ketama_add_server(ketama, '10.0.0.18', 6379, 90);
* // ... etc etc
* // Then create the hash-ring by calling
* Ketama_create_continuum(ketama);
* // Now your ketama object is ready for use.
* // You can map a key to some server like this
* char *my_key = "foobar42";
* int ordinal = Ketama_get_server_ordinal(ketama, my_key, strlen(my_key));
